        <h2 style="text-align: center;">About me</h2>
        <h2>Introduction (?)</h2>   
        <p>I am Tracey Nicole Canon Montes, 16 years old, and I was born on the 25th of May, the year 2007.
          I am the youngest in my family. And I LOVEEEEE Taylor Swift.</p>
        <h2>Disney</h2>
        <p>Growing up, I've always loved watching Disney movies. I would watch at least one movie before I go to bed. Disney played a big part 
          on my childhood as they taught me so many lessons in life, especially at such a young age. If I were to pick, my favorite all-time Disney movie would probably be 
          Inside Out or The Toy Story Movies. It's so hard to pick out of all of them that I've seen, but those are probably on my top list. I watched Inside Out I think when I was in third grade. I loved how
          it made us all understand that it's completely valid to feel whatever we feel. That all of us are going through something, maybe someone's not in the mood as 
          of the moment like the character, Disgust, or maybe they're anxious, like Fear. Anyhow, whatever we feel, that's valid. You're valid.</p>
        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>I think it's safe to say that I had a normal, chill childhood. I liked adventures ever since I was really young. I remember hanging out
          with my cousins and we would inspect our backyard that was full of plants, and we would find snails, earthworms, and the like
          Other than that, I really loved staying indoors as well. Until now, actually. I love the feeling of peace and quiet whenever i'm on my own.
          Personally, I really recommend having a me-time at least once a week. We all deserve that. Imagine having a
          really bad, tough, so full of chaos week. A good ice cream date with yourself is more than enough to gain that social battery that ran out.</p>
          <h2>Bracelet</h2>
          <p>If you're someone who knows me personally, you'd know that I like buying hand-crafted bracelets. Actually, me and my bestfriends, Daphne, Kim, Kalhia, and Renz, once
            bought a set of Taylor Swift-inspired bracelets for each other. It was such a core memory to us because we all don't go to the same school anymore. 
            And with that, we promised each other that whenever we're wearing that specific beaded-bracelet, we got each other no matter what. It may or may not sound cheesy,
            but I loved that. I still do haha. And to this day, we still wear them everyday. That's how special it is. </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
          <p>My family consists of my mom, my dad, my sister, my brother, and me. And yes, to answer that, I a indeed the youngest in my family.
            Talking about it, I guess I can say that I had a normal and happy childhood. I still do until now tho.
            My family always reminds me to enjoy being young, but always look out and take care of myself. I am the youngest, and a girl, so I understand that there may be times where they can
            get pretty strict on me. Looking at it, I love it whenever they do that. It just shows how much they love me and care about me.</p>
        <h2>Random Life Achievements</h2>
          <p>- I got a "most neat" award when I was 7 lol. I still think about that sometimes hahaha, like maybe on a random day, I could be doing something
            then that will just pop in my head all of a sudden. I think it's cute haha
            - My first time getting a prize from a claw machine. Okay, let me get something straight, claw machines are really hard. And getting to
            actually win something could be something to consider as a life achievement. </p>
