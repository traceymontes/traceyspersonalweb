        <h2 style="text-align: center;">School Life</h2>
        <p>I have not much to make kwento about this, but I studied in a religious school like, my whole life. Honestly, I don't think there's 
            anything special about them lmao, except for the fact that, back in junior year, they would make us stop doing whatever every 12-noon to pray during Angelus. Yeah, I guess that's about it. Oh, also the fact that
             we had to surrender our phones before class starts because...well, just because. Yeah, that's it. I met some great friends there. They're the best people in the world.</p>
        <h2>Frenssss</h2>
        <p>I love and adore them so much. We don't see each other ever so often anymore due to our tight schedules, hussling the senior high school life,
            but if there's a special occassion, like birthdays, we won't miss that for the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since we don't see each other that often anymore, we talk through messaging apps a lot. Like literally, everyday. So there's still a connection of course. What happens through
            out the 5 of us' day, and the like. It's like we go to the same school too, it's just that, you know, there's a distance lol. But the bond is still there. It will always be there. </p>
        <br>
        <p>With them, I can be myself. We can be ourselves, and rest assured that the rest wouldn't judge or somewhat. They are my safe place. As cringy as it sounds but anywhere with them feels like
            home. I miss them everyday. I could be doing something, like trying out a new fruit tea flavor, and would think that they'd definitely love this. One thing's for sure is that we are 
            slowly becoming the people we've always imagined. And that is so fulfilling because all throughout our journey, and up to now, we are still around one anothers' lives. </p>
