      <h2>What's the purpose of this website?</h2>
      <p>This website is made for educational purposes. Along with that, you will get to know me into a little more extent. I made this website with the help of W3Schools.
        With HTML and CSS, the codes that I used here are responsive. Feel free to scroll through, read some insights of mine that I put in here.</p>
